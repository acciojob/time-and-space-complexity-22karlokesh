	<h1>Welcome to Accio Jobs! Time, Space, and Complexity.</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity means how much time an algorithm takes to finish, 
		depending on how big the input is. It helps us check how efficient
		the algorithm is, especially when the input is large. 
		By knowing the time complexity, we can compare different solutions 
		and pick the one that works faster and better.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> means how much memory (or space) an algorithm needs to run. 
		It depends on the size of the input, just like time complexity. 
		For example, if an algorithm uses memory that grows with the input size, we say it has O(n) space complexity. 
		This helps us understand how much memory our program will need when the input gets bigger.
